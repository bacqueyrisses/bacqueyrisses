# Hey ðŸ‘‹
I'm Enzo, a web developer from France. I'm passionate about open source projects and have specialized in TypeScript. 
<br />
I've been captivated by the immense potential of Next.js, React, and the ever-expanding Full Stack *JavaScript ecosystem*. Exploring the possibilities they offer has been an exhilarating journey. I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills to new and exciting projects, continuously learn and grow, and make meaningful contributions to the development process.
